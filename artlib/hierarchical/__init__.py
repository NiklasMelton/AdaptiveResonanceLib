"""Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis that seeks to build a
hierarchy of clusters. In divisive clustering, also known as top-down clustering, the
process starts with all data points in a single cluster and recursively splits it into
smaller clusters. This contrasts with agglomerative (bottom-up) clustering, which starts
with individual points and merges them. Divisive clustering is useful when trying to
divide data into broad categories before refining into finer subcategories.

The modules herein are exclusively divisive clustering approaches for ART
