## How to contribute

If you're ready to contribute, here's how you can do it:

1. **Find an issue to work on**, or create a new one if you have a new idea or if you've found a bug. It helps us to assign the issue to you and to keep track of the work being done.

2. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally. Create a new branch for your contributions.

3. **Write or update the code**. Please make sure your code adheres to the existing style in order to keep the codebase consistent. Include comments in your code where necessary.

4. **Write tests**. If you're adding new features or fixing bugs, please add tests that cover your changes.

5. **Run the tests** to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

6. **Update the documentation** if you're adding new features or changing existing behavior. 

7. **Submit a pull request**. Include a clear description of the changes and reference any related issues. 

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. The pull request will be merged once approved by the maintainers.

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. When you are creating a bug report, please include as much detail as possible about the problem. This helps contributors and maintainers to understand the issue and find potential fixes.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's maintainers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

Keep an eye on the GitHub issues for discussions regarding proposed features, a bug, or contributions in general. This is a great way to connect with the community and contribute to a project you like.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AdaptiveResonanceLib!
