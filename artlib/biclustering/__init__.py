"""Biclustering is a data mining technique used to find subgroups of rows and columns in
a matrix that exhibit similar patterns. Unlike traditional clustering, which only groups
rows or columns independently, biclustering simultaneously clusters both dimensions,
allowing for the discovery of local patterns in the data. It is commonly used in fields
such as bioinformatics, particularly for gene expression data analysis, where subsets of
genes and conditions may exhibit correlated behavior.

The ART module contained herein allows for ART to solve biclustering problems.
